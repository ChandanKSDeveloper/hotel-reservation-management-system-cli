## Features 🌟
- **Room Booking**: Add, update, delete, and view bookings.
- **Customer Management**: Manage customer information, including adding, updating, and deleting customers.
- **Room Availability Check**: View available rooms for booking based on current reservations.
- **Exit Confirmation**: Option to safely exit the program with a confirmation prompt.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Validates user inputs and displays appropriate error messages for invalid actions.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Programming Language**: Java (Core Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, and OOP principles)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for interacting with the database
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)
- **JDK Version**: Java 17 or higher

## Prerequisites 🔧
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher
- **MySQL Server**: Ensure it's running
- **MySQL Connector for Java (JDBC Driver)**
- **Java IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other preferred IDE

## How to Run the Project 🚀

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-reservation-management.git
    cd hotel-reservation-management
    ```

2. **Open the project in your Java IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. **Set up the MySQL database**:
    - Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
    - Import the database schema using the provided SQL script (explained below).

4. **Configure Database Connection**:
    - Locate the database connection configuration in your Java code.
    - Update your MySQL credentials:
      ```java
      final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotel_db";
      final String USER = "your_mysql_username";
      final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password";
      ```

5. **Run the project**:
    - Locate and run the `Main.java` file to start the application.

## How it Works ⚙️

The system operates through a menu-driven console interface. Here's a quick overview of the main features:

- **Room Booking**: Allows you to add, view, update, and delete room bookings.
- **Customer Management**: Manages customer information (add, update, delete).
- **Data Persistence**: All data (bookings, customers) is stored in a MySQL database.

## Troubleshooting ⚠️

- **Invalid MySQL Credentials**: Ensure the username and password in the code match your MySQL setup.
- **JDBC Driver Not Found**: If the MySQL Connector JAR is missing, add it to your project's build path. You can download it from [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
- **Database Does Not Exist**: Ensure you've have (hotel_db) database.
